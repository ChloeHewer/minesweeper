The first thing I did was think how I could represent the board so I could randomly assign bombs around it and the spaces would be able to count how many is around them. I decided to use a 2D array to represent this as this way I can have rows and columns (use the numbers as cooridinates on a grid. I use a for loop to create this 2D array. I knew there would be certain functions I would neeed e.g one to create the 2D array, one to add random bombs and on to allow the items in the array to know how many bombs surround them etc.. I used JavaScript as its the language im most comfortable with.
